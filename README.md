## The Role of Alternative Currencies in the Global Marketplace
Abstract:
>The concept of alternative currencies is starting to grow in the global market and can prove
to have lasting implications for the future of money and trade. Currencies are a means of
communicating information about the value of goods and resources that when they fail to do so,
cause market failures and inefficiencies. Alternative currencies provide an opportunity to correct
the information problem presented by traditional currencies and could have a lasting effect on
humanitys attempts at a smooth transition to a more sustainable and efficient future. Bitcoin,
a cryptology based currency, is one such alternative that is currently taking hold in the global
market. This paper will examine exactly how Bitcoins work, why the technology is so effective,
look at Bitcoins history, provide insight into the future of transactions on a global scale, and
ultimately answer the question “What gives money its value?”

## Speedy and Weighted A* Implementations for the Grid-Based Path-Planning Competition
Abstract:
> The Grid-Based Path-Planning Competition is an effort to
facilitate comparison between existing approaches to pathplanning through the use of widely available benchmark
problems. Speedy and Weighted A* are two algorithms that
perform suboptimal search and result in faster computation
time in exchange for less than optimal final path costs. This
paper will discuss the implementation of these algorithms and
analyze the trade-off between optimal final path costs and
computation time. The results of these algorithms will also
be compared against existing approaches made available by
the Grid-Based Path-Planning Competition. This paper also
exists to fulfill a final project requirement for the University of New Hampshire Computer Science Department course
CS830 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
